# Likeastore for Consumers API

This API would allow 3rd party vendors/consumers (eg. recommendation systems) to get the collection of their users favorites (likes) from different social medias into one single stream.

The primary value that API propose is to simplify the integration with different social networks, by implementing OAuth / OAuth 2.0 authorization helpers.
